# Traffic-Light-Recognition-YoloV8
Traffic light recognition for the purpose of aiding colorblind people. This is meant to run on a Jetson Nano and includes a simplified display to make it quick and easy to view results without distracting yourself.
YoloV3 is implemented for the purpose of comparison with the Ultralytics implementation. This repository is not well organized as I anticipate little traffic, but if you're interested in it, let me know and I can help you understand it.
